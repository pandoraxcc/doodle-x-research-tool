## Implementation of traceroute
Performs traceroute and unloads data with some graphs (work in 
progress)</br>
The current traceroute functionality is implemented, but requires:</br>
1.Tests</br>
2.Add the input validation</br></br>

I tested the traceroute with different domains, such as google.com, 
yahoo.com, pandorax.cc ( my website ) and others. The table uploads 
the data and charts are built.</br>
Some websites may require increased TTL in order to retrive the data 
(doodlex's tool default value is 1) as they return stars/empty responses 
</br></br>
