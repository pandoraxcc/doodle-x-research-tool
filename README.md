# Doodle-x-research-tool
Web app that visualizes and performs network scans. </br>I work on this project as a part of my constant learning about security and web development.</br></br>

## Implementation of traceroute

Performs traceroute and unloads data with some graphs</br>
The current traceroute functionality is implemented, but requires:</br>
1.Add the input validation</br></br>

## Implementation of port scan (work in progress)
Performs port scan on the target IP (tested on local host) and provides data in the table.  Implemented with sockets, because works faster with no warnings in Django debug console.</br></br>

## Vulnerability report based on different scenarios(90% completed)

The scan returns stats for:</br>
1.Single vulnerable / non vulnerable port(s);</br>
2.Many vulnerable / non vulnerable ports all together;</br>
3.Either vulnerable or non vulnerable ports.</br>
4.Scan returns no ports (Work in progress)</br>
